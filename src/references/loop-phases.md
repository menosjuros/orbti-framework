## Purpose

Explain the semantics of ORBIT's three loop phases: REFINE, BUILD, INTEGRATE. Every unit of work follows this loop. Skipping phases breaks traceability and increases risk.

## The Loop

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                         │
    ▼                                         │
  REFINE ────────► BUILD ────────► INTEGRATE ───────┘
    │              │               │
    │              │               │
 Define work   Execute work   Reconcile
 Get approval  Verify tasks   Update state
```

## REFINE Phase

**Purpose:** Define what will be built, how it will be verified, and what's out of scope.

**Artifacts Created:**
- `{project}-{refine}-LOOP.md` in `.orbit/projects/{project-name}/`

**Activities:**
1. Analyze requirements and context
2. Define objective (Goal, Purpose, Output)
3. Write acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
4. Break down into tasks with Files, Action, Verify, Done
5. Set boundaries (DO NOT CHANGE, SCOPE LIMITS)
6. Define verification checklist
7. **Wait for approval before proceeding**

**Entry Condition:**
- Prior refine completed (INTEGRATE done) OR first refine
- ROADMAP indicates this project is next

**Exit Condition:**
- LOOP.md created with all required sections
- User has approved the refine
- STATE.md updated to show "ready for BUILD"

**Loop Position:**
```
REFINE ──▶ BUILD ──▶ INTEGRATE
  ✓        ○        ○     [REFINE complete, awaiting BUILD]
```

## BUILD Phase

**Purpose:** Execute the approved refine by completing tasks in order, verifying each.

**Artifacts Created:**
- Code/files specified in LOOP.md
- BUILD-LOG (optional, for complex refines)

**Activities:**
1. Read LOOP.md to load task definitions
2. For each task:
   - Execute the action
   - Run verification
   - Record result (pass/fail)
   - Stop at checkpoints, wait for human
3. Handle blockers by documenting and notifying
4. Track deviations from refine

**Entry Condition:**
- LOOP.md exists and is approved
- STATE.md shows loop position at REFINE complete

**Exit Condition:**
- All tasks completed (or blocked with documentation)
- All verifications passed
- Ready for reconciliation

**Loop Position:**
```
REFINE ──▶ BUILD ──▶ INTEGRATE
  ✓        ✓        ○     [BUILD complete, ready for INTEGRATE]
```

## INTEGRATE Phase

**Purpose:** Reconcile what was planned vs. what was built. Close the loop.

**Artifacts Created:**
- `{project}-{refine}-INTEGRATE.md` in `.orbit/projects/{project-name}/`
- Updated `STATE.md`
- Updated `ROADMAP.md` (if project complete)

**Activities:**
1. Compare LOOP.md tasks to actual execution
2. Document what was built (files, lines)
3. Record acceptance criteria results (PASS/FAIL)
4. Note any deviations and why
5. Update STATE.md:
   - Loop position
   - Progress percentages
   - Session continuity
6. Update ROADMAP.md if phase is complete

**Entry Condition:**
- BUILD phase complete (all tasks done or documented blockers)

**Exit Condition:**
- INTEGRATE.md created with results
- STATE.md updated with new position
- Loop closed, ready for next project REFINE

**Loop Position:**
```
REFINE ──▶ BUILD ──▶ INTEGRATE
  ✓        ✓        ✓     [Loop complete, ready for next REFINE]
```

## Loop Invariants

**Never Skip REFINE:**
```
# BAD
"Let me just quickly implement this without a refine"

# GOOD
"Let me create a LOOP.md first, even for small work"
```
Why: No REFINE = no acceptance criteria = no way to verify completion.

**Never Execute Without Approval:**
```
# BAD
"I've written the refine, now executing..."

# GOOD
"Refine created. Ready to execute when you approve."
```
Why: Refines may have incorrect assumptions. Approval catches issues early.

**Always Close With INTEGRATE:**
```
# BAD
"Tasks done. Moving to next project."

# GOOD
"Tasks done. Creating INTEGRATE.md and updating STATE.md."
```
Why: No INTEGRATE = no record of what was built = lost traceability.

## Phase Transitions

### REFINE → BUILD
Trigger: User approves refine (explicit signal)

Validation:
- [ ] LOOP.md has all required sections
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable
- [ ] Tasks have Files, Action, Verify, Done
- [ ] Boundaries are clear

### BUILD → INTEGRATE
Trigger: All tasks complete OR blockers documented

Validation:
- [ ] Each task verification passed (or blocker recorded)
- [ ] No skipped tasks
- [ ] Deviations noted

### INTEGRATE → REFINE (next)
Trigger: INTEGRATE.md created, STATE.md updated

Validation:
- [ ] INTEGRATE.md has AC results
- [ ] STATE.md reflects new position
- [ ] ROADMAP.md updated if project complete

## Visual Loop Position Format

STATE.md displays loop position visually:

```markdown
## Loop Position

Current loop state:
```
REFINE ──▶ BUILD ──▶ INTEGRATE
  ✓        ○        ○     [Description of current state]
```
```

Symbols:
- `✓` = Phase complete
- `○` = Phase pending
- `►` = Currently in this phase (optional)

## Anti-Patterns

**Partial loops:**
```
REFINE → BUILD → (skip INTEGRATE) → REFINE
```
Why bad: No record of what was built. Can't track progress.

**Implicit approval:**
```
"I assume the refine is approved and will proceed"
```
Why bad: May execute on flawed assumptions. Always wait for explicit approval.

**INTEGRATE debt:**
```
"I'll write the INTEGRATE later"
```
Why bad: Context degrades. Write INTEGRATE immediately after BUILD.
