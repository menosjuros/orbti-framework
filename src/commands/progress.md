<objective>
Show current progress and **route to exactly ONE next action**. Prevents decision fatigue by suggesting a single best path.

**When to use:**
- Mid-session check on progress
- After `/orbit:resume` for more context
- When unsure what to do next
- To get a tailored suggestion based on your current focus
</objective>

$ARGUMENTS

@.orbit/STATE.md
@.orbit/ROADMAP.md
</context>

<process>

<step name="load_state">
Read `.orbit/STATE.md` and `.orbit/ROADMAP.md`:
- Current phase and total phases
- Current refine (if any)
- Loop position (REFINE/BUILD/INTEGRATE markers)
- Roadmap progress
- Performance metrics (if tracked)
- Blockers or concerns
</step>

<step name="calculate_progress">
Determine overall progress:

**Milestone Progress:**
- Phases complete: X of Y
- Current phase progress: Z%

**Current Loop:**
- Position: REFINE/BUILD/INTEGRATE
- Status: [what's happening]
</step>

<step name="consider_user_context">
**If `[context]` argument provided:**

User has given additional context about their current focus or constraint.
Factor this into routing decision:
- "I need to fix a bug first" → prioritize that over planned work
- "I only have 30 minutes" → suggest smaller scope
- "I want to finish this phase" → stay on current path
- "I'm stuck on X" → suggest debug or research approach

**If no argument:** Use default routing based on state alone.
</step>

<step name="determine_routing">
Based on state (+ user context if provided), determine **ONE** next action:

**Default routing (no user context):**

| Situation | Single Suggestion |
|-----------|-------------------|
| No refine exists | `/orbit:refine` |
| Refine awaiting approval | "Approve refine to proceed" |
| Refine approved, not executed | `/orbit:build [path]` |
| Applied, not unified | `/orbit:integrate [path]` |
| Loop complete, more phases | `/orbit:refine` (next phase) |
| Milestone complete | "Create next milestone or ship" |
| Blockers present | "Address blocker: [specific]" |
| Context at DEEP/CRITICAL | `/orbit:pause` |

**With user context:** Adjust suggestion to align with stated intent.

**IMPORTANT:** Suggest exactly ONE action. Not multiple options.

If context is at DEEP or CRITICAL bracket:
