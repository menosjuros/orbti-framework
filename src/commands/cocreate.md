<objective>
Execute technical discovery to inform planning decisions. Produces COCREATE.md with findings, recommendation, and confidence level.

**When to use:** Before planning a project with technical unknowns (library selection, architecture decisions, integration approaches).

**Distinct from /orbti:research:** Research gathers documentation/information. Cocreate makes technical decisions.

**Not part of the main loop** — run explicitly when there are genuine technical unknowns to resolve.

**Follow workflow: @~/.claude/orbti-framework/workflows/cocreate.md**

The workflow implements:
1. Determine depth level (quick/standard/deep)
2. Identify unknowns for the project
3. Research options using subagents
4. Cross-verify findings
5. Create COCREATE.md with recommendation
6. Assign confidence level
7. Route to planning when complete
</process>
