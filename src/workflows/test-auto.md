<purpose>
Auto-detect the project's test runner, write integration tests for any acceptance criteria without coverage, run tests, and map results to ACs.

Falls back to manual UAT if no test runner is found and --e2e is not passed.
</purpose>

<test_runner_detection>
Detect test runner by inspecting project files — use what's already there, install nothing new.

```bash
# Node / JavaScript
cat package.json 2>/dev/null | grep -E '"test"|"jest"|"vitest"|"mocha"'

# Python
ls pytest.ini pyproject.toml setup.cfg conftest.py 2>/dev/null

# Go
ls go.mod 2>/dev/null && find . -name "*_test.go" -not -path "*/vendor/*" | head -3

# Rust
ls Cargo.toml 2>/dev/null && grep -r "#\[test\]" src/ --include="*.rs" | head -3

# Other
ls Makefile 2>/dev/null && grep -E "^test:" Makefile
```

**Decision matrix:**

| Found | Runner | Run command |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `jest` in package.json | Jest | `npx jest --testPathPattern=<pattern>` |
| `vitest` in package.json | Vitest | `npx vitest run` |
| `pytest.ini` or `conftest.py` | Pytest | `python -m pytest` |
| `*_test.go` files | Go test | `go test ./...` |
| `#[test]` in Rust | Cargo | `cargo test` |
| `test:` in Makefile | Make | `make test` |
| None found | — | Fall back to manual UAT |

<step name="identify_scope">
**Determine what to test:**

If $ARGUMENTS provided: find corresponding REFINE.md and INTEGRATE.md
If not: use most recently modified REFINE.md

Read REFINE.md to extract:
- All acceptance criteria (AC-1, AC-2, ...)
- Files created/modified (from INTEGRATE.md if exists)
- Boundaries (what was NOT changed)
</step>

<step name="detect_runner">
**Auto-detect test runner:**

Run the detection commands above.

If `--e2e` flag passed:
- Check if Playwright CLI is available: `npx playwright --version 2>/dev/null`
- If available: add E2E test writing to the refine
- If not available: warn user and continue with integration tests only

If no runner found and no --e2e:
```
No test runner detected in this project.

Falling back to manual UAT.
```

</step>

<step name="map_acs_to_tests">
**Verify tests were written during BUILD:**

Tests should already exist — they are written during BUILD alongside the implementation.

For each AC in the REFINE.md, confirm a test exists:
```bash
grep -r "AC-[0-9]" tests/ spec/ __tests__/ test/ 2>/dev/null
```

If any AC has no test:
- Warn: "AC-N has no test — was BUILD completed? Writing test now."
- Write the missing test before running (same rules as BUILD: one test per AC, behavior not implementation, no new dependencies)
</step>

<step name="run_tests">
**Run the test suite:**

Run only tests related to the current refine's scope when possible.
If the runner supports file filtering, prefer that over running the full suite.

Capture full output. Look for:
- Pass / fail counts
- Which specific tests failed
- Error messages for failures
</step>

<step name="map_results_to_acs">
**Map test results back to ACs:**

Build a results table:

```
AC-1: [description] ........... PASS
AC-2: [description] ........... FAIL — [error summary]
AC-3: [description] ........... PASS
```

For each FAIL:
- Extract the error message
- Note which test file and line
- Categorize: assertion error / exception / timeout / setup failure
</step>

<step name="handle_e2e_optional">
**E2E with Playwright CLI (--e2e flag or e2e.default: true in config):**

Check config and flag:
```bash
# Check if enabled by default in config
grep -A3 "^e2e:" .orbit/config.md 2>/dev/null | grep "default: true"

# Check if playwright-cli is installed
playwright-cli --version 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_INSTALLED"
```

If not installed:
```
Playwright CLI not installed. Run /orbit:enable-e2e to set it up.
Continuing with integration tests only.
```

If installed, after integration tests pass:

1. Read `base_url` from `.orbit/config.md` (e2e.base_url)
   If empty, ask user: "What is your app's base URL? (e.g. http://localhost:3000)"

2. For each user-facing AC, write a minimal Playwright CLI test:
   ```bash
   # Tests go in tests/e2e/ or playwright/ (match project convention)
   # Use playwright-cli snapshot to inspect the page structure first:
   playwright-cli goto <base_url>
   playwright-cli snapshot
   # Then write tests based on what's found
   ```

3. Run E2E tests via playwright-cli:
   ```bash
   playwright-cli goto <base_url>
   # Execute the scenario steps for each AC
   playwright-cli screenshot  # capture evidence
   ```

4. Map results to ACs. E2E failures are **warnings**, not blockers —
   log them as issues in UAT file but do not block INTEGRATE.
   Flakiness is real; integration test failures block, E2E failures warn.
</step>

<step name="report_and_route">
**Present results and route:**

```
════════════════════════════════════════
TEST RESULTS: [Refine Name]
════════════════════════════════════════

Runner: [detected runner]
Tests written: [N new] / [M existing]

AC-1: ✓ PASS
AC-2: ✗ FAIL — [error]
AC-3: ✓ PASS

Tests: [total] | Passed: [N] | Failed: [N]

E2E: [PASS | SKIP — reason]

════════════════════════════════════════
Verdict: [ALL PASS | FAILURES FOUND]
════════════════════════════════════════
```

**If FAILURES FOUND:**
- Log each failing AC to `.orbit/projects/XX-name/{plan}-UAT.md`
- Offer: "Run /orbit:refine-fix to address failing tests before integrating"
- User can override and continue to human verification anyway (with issues logged)

**After automated results (regardless of pass/fail):**

Always proceed to human verification. Automated tests validate code behavior — they cannot replace human judgment on UX, visual correctness, and real-world usage.

```

⚠ Testes automatizados não substituem a verificação humana.

```

→ Follow: @~/.claude/orbit-framework/workflows/verify-work.md

Human verification runs for every AC, independent of automated results. An AC that passes automated tests can still fail human review — that outcome is valid and must be captured.
