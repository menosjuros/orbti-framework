# ORBIT Command Reference

**ORBIT** (Observe, Refine, Build, Integrate, Test) is a structured AI-assisted development framework for Claude Code.

## The Loop

Every unit of work follows this cycle:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  REFINE ──▶ BUILD ──▶ INTEGRATE          │
│                                     │
│  Define    Execute    Reconcile     │
│  work      tasks      & close       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Never skip INTEGRATE.** Every refine needs a summary.

## Quick Start

1. `/orbit:init` - Initialize ORBIT in your project
2. `/orbit:refine` - Create a refine for your work
3. `/orbit:build` - Execute the approved refine
4. `/orbit:integrate` - Close the loop with summary

## Core Loop Commands

### `/orbit:init`
Initialize ORBIT in a project.

- Creates `.orbit/` directory structure
- Creates PROJECT.md, STATE.md, ROADMAP.md
- Prompts for project context and phases
- Optionally configures integrations (SonarQube, etc.)

Usage: `/orbit:init`

---

### `/orbit:refine [project]`
Enter REFINE phase - create an executable refine.

- Reads current state from STATE.md
- Creates LOOP.md with tasks, acceptance criteria, boundaries
- Populates skills section from SPECIAL-FLOWS.md (if configured)
- Updates loop position

Usage: `/orbit:refine` (auto-detects next project)
Usage: `/orbit:refine 3` (specific project)

---

### `/orbit:build [refine-path]`
Execute an approved LOOP.md file.

- **Blocks if required skills not loaded** (from SPECIAL-FLOWS.md)
- Validates refine exists and hasn't been executed
- Executes tasks sequentially
- Handles checkpoints (decision, human-verify, human-action)
- Reports completion and prompts for INTEGRATE

Usage: `/orbit:build`
Usage: `/orbit:build .orbit/projects/01-foundation/01-01-LOOP.md`

---

### `/orbit:integrate [refine-path]`
Reconcile refine vs actual and close the loop.

- Creates INTEGRATE.md documenting what was built
- Audits skill invocations (if SPECIAL-FLOWS.md configured)
- Records decisions made, deferred issues
- Updates STATE.md with loop closure
- **Required** - never skip this step

Usage: `/orbit:integrate`
Usage: `/orbit:integrate .orbit/projects/01-foundation/01-01-LOOP.md`

---

### `/orbit:help`
Show this command reference.

Usage: `/orbit:help`

---

### `/orbit:status` *(deprecated)*
> Use `/orbit:progress` instead.

Shows current loop position. Deprecated in favor of `/orbit:progress` which provides better routing.

---

## Session Commands

### `/orbit:pause [reason]`
Create handoff file and prepare for session break.

- Creates HANDOFF.md with complete context
- Updates STATE.md session continuity section
- Designed for context limits or multi-session work

### `/orbit:resume [handoff-path]`
Restore context from handoff and continue work.

- Reads STATE.md and any HANDOFF files

- Suggests exactly ONE next action
- Archives consumed handoffs

Usage: `/orbit:resume`
Usage: `/orbit:resume .orbit/HANDOFF-context.md`

---

### `/orbit:progress [context]`
Smart status with routing - suggests ONE next action.

## Task Types

|------|---------|
| `auto` | Fully autonomous execution |
| `checkpoint:decision` | Choices requiring human input |
| `checkpoint:human-verify` | Visual/functional verification |
| `checkpoint:human-action` | Manual steps (rare) |

## Common Workflows

**Starting a new project:**
```
/orbit:init → /orbit:refine → /orbit:build → /orbit:integrate
```

**Checking where you are:**
```
/orbit:progress
```

**Resuming work (new session):**
```
/orbit:resume
```

**Pre-planning exploration:**
```
/orbit:cocreate 3 → /orbit:assumptions 3 → /orbit:research "topic" → /orbit:refine 3
```



## Key Principles

1. **Loop must complete** - REFINE -> BUILD -> INTEGRATE, no shortcuts
2. **State is tracked** - STATE.md knows where you are
3. **Boundaries are real** - Respect DO NOT CHANGE sections
4. **Acceptance criteria first** - Define done before starting
5. **Skills are enforced** - Required skills block BUILD until loaded

## Getting Help

- Run `/orbit:progress` to see where you are and what to do next
- Read `.orbit/PROJECT.md` for project context
- Read `.orbit/STATE.md` for current position
- Check `.orbit/ROADMAP.md` for project overview
